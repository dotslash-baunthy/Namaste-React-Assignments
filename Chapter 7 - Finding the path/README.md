## Q1. What are the various ways to add images into our app? Explain with code example.

## Q2. What would happen if we do `console.log(useState())`?
A. It logs and array of length 2. The first element is the starting value (in this case it is blank). The second element is a function which allows us to change the value of a state variable. useState can be destructured and the two elements have their values assigned to constants in our code.

## Q3. How will `useEffect` behave if we don't add a dependency array?

## Q4. What is an SPA?

## Q5. What is the difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
